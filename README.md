# Digital-Image-Processing_Raw-Image-To-File---AUTh
In this project, we take an image in Raw format (array of values in [0,1]) and we demosaic it assuming Bayer pattern, downsample it using 2 different methods, quantize and dequantize it and create a PPM representation to save it as a file.

Running the demo file will produce an image (from the given data) that has been through all the phases described above. The report and assignment file will provide a better understanding, asssuming you can read Greek (English version will come out).
This project was developed as an assignment for AUTh.
